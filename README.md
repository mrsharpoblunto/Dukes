Dukes
=====

The Dukebox of Hazzard, a media player with a web UI that allows multiple users to share their music over a single set of speakers. The webUI is based off bootstrap and is designed to work on a variety of devices from phones & tablets up to desktop screens.

To use Dukes, you will need to run DukesServer.exe which will open a UI for configuring the server, once you have done this, you will want to add users and media sources via the UI. After some initial users and media sources have been defined, you can actually start queueing up music to be played by connecting to the webUI using a web browser (DukesServer.exe hosts the webUI, so if you close this then the server will also close)
